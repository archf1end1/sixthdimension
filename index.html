                        <p>Our first mission is to launch our state-of-the-art space station module "Space Colosseum" in lower earth
                            orbit which will act as an All-Facillity-Center for every space mission, for everyone. Unlike ISS or other Space Station whose 
                            main objective is to act as a hub for research, on the other hand Colosseum provides all kind of facility from assembling whole rocket in space(Our main mission 
                            is to assemble our own state-of-the-art rocket in space) to 3D printing medicines and from acting as fuel station for rockets(Starship need multiple refueling
                            in earth orbit to go on) to storage facility for storing future payloads.

                        <p>Our second but most import mission is to assemble our full state-of-the-art rocket in space inside our Colosseum.
                            In future it will get more and more difficult to make bigger rocket in earth and launch from the earth sufrace but we will need 
                            a ship which has capabilty of shiping heavy weights by assuming less fuel which is only possible if we start building/assembling rockets in space.
                            On earth gravity is biggest challenge but in space it is the biggest plus point.
                            From there we can easily launch ship for a long journey

                        <p>Our third mission is to build critical infrastucture on the moon which will act as an base for others to achieve what they want.
                            We have decide to build an camp where future astronauts can stay when they will land.
                            One of the most challenging but crucial task is to establish an reactor on moon which will provide constant supply
                            of power to the moon citizen even when there is night for 14 staright days on the moon.
